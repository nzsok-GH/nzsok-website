## Gallery CMS Pipeline

Albums are managed through the CMS at `/admin`. The flow:

1. Editor logs in at `/admin` and creates or edits an album.
2. Decap CMS commits a `.md` file to `_albums/` and photos to `images/albums/`.
3. Vercel detects the new commit and triggers a build.
4. `build-albums.js` parses all `.md` frontmatter and writes `public/albums.json`.
5. `Gallery.tsx` fetches `/albums.json` at runtime; falls back to `SAMPLE_ALBUMS` if the fetch fails.

To hide an album without deleting it, add `published: false` to its `.md` file — `build-albums.js` filters those out.

---

## Styling Conventions

Brand tokens are declared once in `src/index.css` under `@theme {}` (available as Tailwind utilities like `bg-navy`, `text-gold`) and mirrored in `:root {}` as CSS custom properties (`var(--navy)`) for use in custom CSS rules.

Animations, pseudo-elements, and complex gradients are written as regular CSS classes below the theme block — not in Tailwind config.
